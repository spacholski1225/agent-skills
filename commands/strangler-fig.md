# Strangler Fig Pattern

I've read the Strangler Fig Pattern skill and I'm using it to incrementally replace legacy code safely.

Read the skill file: @~/.claude/skills/refactoring/strangler-fig-pattern/SKILL.md

Follow the strangler fig workflow to gradually replace legacy systems while keeping production stable.
