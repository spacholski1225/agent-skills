# Dependency Mapping Skill

I've read the Dependency Mapping skill and I'm using it to map dependencies and understand the blast radius of changes.

Read the skill file: @~/.claude/skills/analysis/dependency-mapping/SKILL.md

Follow the dependency mapping workflow to understand what depends on what, measure coupling, and identify refactoring risks.
