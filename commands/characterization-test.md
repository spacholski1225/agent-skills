# Characterization Testing

I've read the Characterization Testing skill and I'm using it to create a safety net before modifying legacy code.

Read the skill file: @~/.claude/skills/refactoring/characterization-testing/SKILL.md

Follow the characterization testing workflow to document current behavior before making changes.
