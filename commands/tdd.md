# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

I've read the Test-Driven Development skill and I'm using it to implement this feature following the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

Read the skill file: @~/.claude/skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md

Follow the TDD workflow: Write failing test first (RED), make it pass (GREEN), then refactor (REFACTOR).
