# Code Archaeology Skill

I've read the Code Archaeology skill and I'm using it to understand unfamiliar code through systematic investigation.

Read the skill file: @~/.claude/skills/analysis/code-archaeology/SKILL.md

Follow the archaeology workflow to understand what the code does, why it exists, and how it works.
